This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `$unwind` operator in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. The `$unwind` operator is used to deconstruct arrays into individual documents, but it fails when attempting to unwind an empty array. This can occur if a document in the collection lacks the field to be unwound or if that field is an empty array. The solution provides a method to handle this edge case gracefully.
